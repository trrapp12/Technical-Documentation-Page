            but
            didn't really learn well.
            I'm offering them here as a guide to people who are just out of bootcamps on some principles that really
            would
            have helped speed my progression
            I had been able to learn them better at the beginnng.</p>
          <p> Please remember this is a work in progress. Some sections may have missing information. I balance many
            priorities among this one. Please be patient</p>

          <p>What is the <code>!doctype html</code> and what is it used for? The best explanation I have found is on the
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/Doctype">W3C website</a>
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <h3>Don't forget to add a doctype</h3><br>
            <b>add what?</b><br>
            For historical reasons, browsers behave more predictably and more uniformly when they parse HTML documents
            that start with a so-called Doctype declaration: <br>
            <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>
            <br>
            <b>Why?</b>
            <br>
            Initially, the Doctype declaration was used in HTML when it was defined as a language based on SGML, and
            later, on XML.
            <br>
            Since the presence of that declaration was in general a signal that the document author followed standard
            practices,
            that declaration was used in HTML5 to distinguish between a standards-compliant parsing mode and a so-called
            quirks parsing mode.
            <br>
            Whether you want to parse HTML files via an SGML or an XML parser, or simply make sure that your document
            gets
            parsed the same way
            across HTML5 processors, the doctype is a critical component of a quality HTML document.
          </blockquote>
          <p> In other words, your browser can parse your document into more than just html. The doctype tells it what
            to
            parse it into. And as for "quirks mode",
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Quirks_Mode_and_Standards_Mode">MDN</a> explains
            that best.
          <blockquote>
            <h3>Quirks Mode and Standards Mode</h3><br>
            In the old days of the web, pages were typically written in two versions: One for Netscape Navigator,
            and one for Microsoft Internet Explorer. When the web standards were made at W3C,
            browsers could not just start using them, as doing so would break most existing sites on the web.
            Browsers therefore introduced two modes to treat new standards compliant sites differently from old legacy
            sites.
            <br>
            There are now three modes used by the layout engines in web browsers: quirks mode, almost standards mode,
            and
            full standards mode.
            In <br>quirks mode</b>, layout emulates nonstandard behavior in Navigator 4 and Internet Explorer 5.
            This is essential in order to support websites that were built before the widespread adoption of web
            standards.
            In <b>full standards mode</b>, the behavior is (hopefully) the behavior described by the HTML and CSS
            specifications.
            In <b>almost standards mode</b>, there are only a very small number of quirks implemented.

        <header>What is actually new with HTML5?</header>
        <article>
          <p>This one comes up a lot in Front-End Coding Interviews. Unfortunately a lot of people coming out of
            bootcamps
            didn't necessarily
            learn coding before the implemenation of the new standards. This puts them at a disadvantage of knowing what
            is new if you never experienced
            what the old was like. So here's a brief overview of some of the new info as provided by <a

          <p><b>VIDEO TUTORIALS DON'T WORK!!!</b>. So I spent a lot of time and money running through video tutorials. I
            thought they would get me so far so quick. But they didn't. The reason isn't
            that they are inherently bad. It's that they are inherently passive. You can speed through one, have a
            working
            project at the end, and still have no idea what you did.
            The key to making them work is turning it into an active learning environment. For me this meant adding six
            key ingredients. </p>
          <ul>
            <li class="code-button">Identify</li>
            <p>Identify means that any time I came across any type of word or concept I hadn't heard of or wasn't
              unquestionably proficient at I had to identify it as a weakness.
              <li>Question:</li>
            <p> Once I had identified something, I had to question it. What does the word mean? What are all the working
              parts in this concept? What concept do I need to know
              as a prerequisite to understanding this concept? And what weaknesses can I identify in those?
              <li>Describe:</li>
            <p> One of the best ways to know if you understand a concept is to explain it to a third grader. If you can
              take a very intricate concept and reduce it down to the most
              basic explanation without losing the
              <li>Experiment:</li>
            <p>Once I find a new concept I need to work on, and I've questioned it, and then been able to get enough
              academic knowledge that I can describe it, now I have to experiment.
              Everything changes in the wild. And not even the best laid plans survive first contact.
              <li>Create a Feedback Loop:</li>
            <p>Feedback loops are simply a way to check to see if you are progressing in the right direction. It is
              completely possible to run 1000 mph and not get anywhere. I have
              expended countless hours on projects, but my own observational biases may prevent me from seeing areas I'm
              lacking, my fears may prevent me from expanding into new areas,
              and I just sometimes don't know what I don't know. All of these reasons are great reasons to create some
              type of feedback loop, whether it's through tests, code challenges,
              mentors, or meetup groups. Find someway to get some feedback on your progress so your progress won't all
              be
              for naught.
              <li>Repetition:</li>
            <p>Neuro-biology has spoken. We simply cannot learn without repeatably using the same neuropathways inorder
              to
              strengthen them. Learning cannot happen without repetition.

          <h3>Temporal dead zone (TDZ)</h3>
          <blockquote>let variables cannot be read/written until they have been fully initialized,
            which happens when they are declared (if no initial value is specified on declaration,
            the variable is initialized with a value of undefined). Accessing the variable before the
            initialization results in a ReferenceError.
            <em>Note: This differs from var variables, which will return a value of undefined if they are accessed
              before
              they are declared.</em>
            The variable is said to be in a "temporal dead zone" (TDZ) from the start of the block until the
            initialization has completed.
            <pre>
                <code class="code-block">
                  { // TDZ starts at beginning of scope
                    console.log(bar); // undefined
                    console.log(foo); // ReferenceError
                    var bar = 1;
                    let foo = 2; // End of TDZ (for foo)
                  }
                </code>
              </pre>
            The term "temporal" is used because the zone depends on the order of execution (time) rather than the order
            in
            which the code is written (position).
            For example, the code below works because, even though the function that uses the let variable appears
            before
            the variable is declared, the function is called outside the TDZ.

          </p>
          <blockquote>
            Constants are block-scoped, much like variables declared using the let keyword.
            The value of a constant can't be changed through reassignment
            (i.e. by using the assignment operator), and it can't be redeclared
            (i.e. through a variable declaration). <b>However, if a constant is an
              object or array its properties or items can be updated or removed.</b>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Check out this example:</p>
          <pre>
                <code class="code-block">
                  const a = [1, 2];
                  //const a is declared and defined as an array with two values...'1' and '2'
                  const a = [1, 2, 3];
                  //will return 'TypeError: invalid assignment' because a const can't be reassigned
                  const.push(3);
                  console.log(a);
                  //returns [1, 2, 3] because you can still modify the items or properties of arrays and objects

          <p>Here are a few commonly used Git Commands. Learning how to use the CLI in your favorite IDE (mine is Atom)
            will make a ton of difference in how fast you can accomplish things</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>mkdir folderName</code> makes a new folder with the name "folderName"</li>
            <li><code>cd folderName </code> navigates into the "folderName" folder</li>
            <li><code>cd .. </code> navigates out of the "folderName" folder</li>
            <li><code>ls</code> shows anything else in the folder</li>
            <li><code class="code-block">echo "# delete-me" >> README.md
                  git init
                  git add README.md
                  git commit -m "first commit"
                  git branch -M main
                  git remote add origin https://github.com/accountName/File-Name.git
                  git push -u origin main
                </code> This series of commands writes a file "README.md", initializes a new git directory, adds the
              README.md file, creates the first commit statement, creates and sets the
              branch you will be making commits to as "main", sets the remote git server repo to the repo named
              "File-Name" in the 'accountName' account, and then pushes all of that to the remote repo.
              It's a classical order of commands used to start any new Github Repo on your local computer.</li>
            <li><code>git status</code> shows what folders have changes and will or won't be pushed if you make a push
              at
              the current point.</li>
            <li><code>git add -A</code> adds all of the untracked changes to a tracked status</li>
            <li><code>git commit -m ""</code> adds a commit message with whatever is in between the quotes</li>
            <li><code>git push</code> pushes local changes to the github repo</li>
            <li><code>git checkout</code> shows at any certain commit what the changes were that were made (so you can
              get
              an idea which commit to revert to if you need to change)</li>
            <li><code>git merge</code> merges changes from working branches into main branches</li>
            <li><code>git fetch</code> sometimes your changes get pushed wrong and you have to "store" them while you're
              trying to fix a problem before they can then be pushed. This is usually
              accomplished with a <code>git fetch</code> and a <code>git stash</code></li>
            <li><code>git pull</code> ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS do this before a <code>git push</code>. It pulls down other
              co-workers changes into your changes before you push yours. If this doesn't
              happeny, you often overwrite hours, days or even weeks of their hard work.</li>

        <article>
          <p>Actually as part of this project I had to learn a few things about creating a sticky menu.
            It's not just as easy as adding <code>position: sticky;</code> in your CSS. You need a few things:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The following code needs to be on the element you want to stick:
              <code class="code-block">

                  .sticky {
                    position: sticky;
                    top: 0;
                    left: 0;
                  }
  
                </code>Notice it takes all three things. The position, the top to indicate where it needs to start
              sticking. And
              the left indicates how far aligned left it is. Also, notice it's just "0", not "0px".
            </li>
            <li>Parent element needs to have <code>display: block</code></li>
            <li>There needs to be at least two child elements. Otherwise there is nothing for the sticky element to
              'float' over.</li>
            <li>Parent element cannot have <code>overflow: hidden</code>, <code>overflow: scroll</code>, or
              <code>overflow: auto</code>
            </li>
            <li>Parent element can't have <code>display: flexbox;</code>. This was my problem. I got around it by
              keeping
              my containers I need to have flex with
              flexbox and then put a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> inbetween the parent and child and making the div the new
              parent and giving it a <code>display: block;</code></li>
